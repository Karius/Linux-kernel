### Linux-0.11_source.pdf 
It contains the source code of Linux Kernel v0.11 from http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-devel-040329.zip

I compile this file due to my study of Linux 0.11 source code for a details understanding of how operation system works. It is handy to have a single document containing the directory, files, and the source code. Save my life in switching between different files under different directory.
