# Linux kernel
Collection of Linux kernel from internet, trying to contribute as far as I can reach at the age of 50. The major reference sites are

* http://oldlinux.org/
* http://www.examw.com/linux/all/200572/    /* Linux 0.11 boot strap flow in Simplified Chinese */


### [file] Linux-0.11_source.pdf 
It contains the source code of Linux Kernel v0.11 from http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-devel-040329.zip

This file is compiled for easier accessibility Linux 0.11 source code to assist me to get a details understanding of how operation system works. It is handy to have a single document containing the directory, files, and the source code. Save my life in switching between different files under different directory.

### [Directory] : Linux 0.11 on VirtualBox
Linux 0.11 was released on 1991/12/8, which was the first functional version of Linux kernel. There are many documents about the impmentation of Linux 0.11 running on Bochs, Qemu. I saw no one doing it on VirtualBox, which I am more familiar with, than Bochs. It it simple and straightforward, though still took me some time to get it right. So I document it in this directory with the files download from http://oldlinux.org/ and some modifications.

### [Directory] : Linux 0.97 on VirtualBox
Since it works with Linux 0.11 on VirtualBox, why not makes it work with Linux 0.97 especial when people think Linux 0.11 is too prelimiary from modern Linux environment. Linux 0.97 adds virtual file systems and network support, which was released on 1992/8/1.

### [Directory] : Linux 0.97 on Qemu
I am not familiar with Qemu. Try to replicate what people have done on running Linux 0.11 on Qemu. However, it seems that many of related documents (in Chinese) coming from the same source, making the same mistakes. So document it with correction to make sure it works properly.
